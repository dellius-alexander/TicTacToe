# Set Theory

## Special sets

- ∅ The empty set is the set which contains no elements.
- U The universe set is the set of all elements.
- N The set of natural numbers. That is, N 􏰀 {0, 1, 2, 3 . . .}.
- Z The set of integers. That is, Z 􏰀 {. . . , −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}.
- Q The set of rational numbers.
- R The set of real numbers.
- P(A) The power set of any set A is the set of all subsets of A.

## Set Theory Notation.

- {,} We use these braces to enclose the elements of a set. So {1, 2, 3} is the set containing 1, 2, and 3.
- : { x: x > 2}isthesetofallxsuchthatxisgreaterthan2.
- ∈ 2 ∈ {1,2,3} asserts that 2 is an element of the set {1,2,3}.
- &#x2209; 4 &#x2209;; {1,2,3} because 4 is not an element of the set {1,2,3}.
- ⊆ A ⊆B assertsthatAisasubsetofB:everyelementofAis also an element of B.
- ⊂ A ⊂ B asserts that A is a proper subset of B: every element of A is also an element of B, but A 􏰃 B.
- ∩ A ∩ B is the intersection of A and B: the set containing all elements which are elements of both A and B.
- ∪ A∪B is the union of A and B: is the set containing all elements which are elements of A or B or both.
- × A × B is the Cartesian product of A and B: the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) with a ∈ A and b ∈ B.
- \ A \ B is A set-minus B: the set containing all elements of A which are not elements of B.
- &#x0100; The complement of A is the set of everything which is not an element of A.
- |A| The cardinality (or size) of A is the number of elements in A.
